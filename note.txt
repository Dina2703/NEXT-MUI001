NEXT.js set up with MUI version 5

all filed have .txs extention. A TSX file is a TypeScript (. TS) file written using JSX syntax

to run the app 
'yarn dev'   command
--------1 step configure @emotion.------------
1) 
yarn add @emotion/react   //install emotion package
2)
add this to .eslintrc file:
"extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"], // make sure prettier is last
2)
@emotion/eslint-plugin          // for error output, making shur that we are following the best practices for the Emotion plugin.
add some config to the 
it gives error if , you imported-->
import styled from 'react-emotion'
the correct way will be   --->
import styled from @emotion/styled
add this to .eslintrc file -->
  "plugins": ["@emotion"],
  "rules": {
    "@emotion/jsx-import": "error",  //this line, auto adds /* @jsx jsx */ to our Compoents files.
    "@emotion/no-vanilla": "error",
    "@emotion/import-from-emotion": "error",
    "@emotion/styled-import": "error"
  },

/* @jsx jsx */   this thins required for every component page, without it we can use @emotion jsx, props like 'css' from emotion doesn't realize that they're in  a emotion jsx componet. Without 'css' props can't add some style rules to the components. 
/** @jsxRuntime classic */        this code for the React 17 new version, which has two runtime options,old one is  'classic' and the new one is 'automatic'.

3)create custom babel config for Next.js file, 
.babelrc  the file name in project root folder. 
and install optional plugin, that helps optimize slyles, creates a better developer experince overall. Some of the features that come with the lugin are 
* minification
* dead code elimination
* source maps
* components as selectors

yarn add --dev @emotion/babel-plugin

Now we can start implementing some Components.

in EmotionButton.tsx the FC stands for functional component  created with @emotion

------Prefferable way how to use @emotion-----------
with styled APi, which is very similar to styled Component.
for that we can add another library called '@emotion\styled'  to install it --> 
yarn add @emotion/styled

that gives us access ro styled elements.
StyledEmotionButton.tsx   component created with @emotion/styled.
